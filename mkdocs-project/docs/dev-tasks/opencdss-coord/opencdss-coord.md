# TSTool / Development Tasks / OpenCDSS Coordination

TSTool software has been funded to a large extent by the State of Colorado as part of
[Colorado's Decision Support Systems](http://cdss.state.co.us).
The Open Water Foundation has been working on a project to migrate TSTool and other CDSS software to open source projects.
This involves many coordination threads, which are converging on final open source projects.
Activities include the following:

1. Selecting and implementing open source licenses.
2. Managing software in GitHub:
	1. initially in private repositories and later public
	2. initially using the [Open Water Foundation's GitHub](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation) account and later the
	[State's OpenCDSS](https://github.com/OpenCDSS) account (only public repositories).
3. Updating the development environment and associated documentation.
4. Working with State of Colorado to implement full open source projects with appropriate
staffing and governance.

High level coordination is linked to many detailed issues, such as making sure that documentation
points to correct repositories, websites, etc., which will migrate over time.
