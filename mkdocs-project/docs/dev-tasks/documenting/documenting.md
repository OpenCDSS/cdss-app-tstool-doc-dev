# TSTool / Development Tasks / Documenting 

TSTool documentation is generally split into user documentation and developer documentation.
User documentation focuses on explanation of the software installation and features, and
providing reference documentation for commands, datastores, etc.
TSTool documentation should follow conventions of the developer and user documentation.

*   See the [TSTool Developer Documentation repository](https://github.com/OpenCDSS/cdss-app-tstool-doc-dev)

There has not been a focus on creating API documentation, such as using Javadoc,
mainly because libraries have not been publicly available.
However, much of the code is heavily documented using Javadoc conventions,
which allows Eclipse to display information that is useful to developers.
Creating and publishing standard navigable HTML Javadoc documentation is a worthy endeavor if resources allow.
