## Install on Windows ##

The installer program can be run on Windows to install TSTool on a computer for each user.
TSTool will install in a new folder such as `C:\CDSS\TSTool-12.05.00` for each version.
This ensures that users can run different versions of TSTool needed for specific projects and processes.
See the [TSTool Installation and Configuration Appendix](http://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/cdss-app-tstool-doc-user/appendix-install/install/).

## Install on Linux ##

TSTool can also be installed on Linux, typically in the `/opt/` folder.
