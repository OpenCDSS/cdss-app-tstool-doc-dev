# TSTool / Development Tasks / Compiling #

The Eclipse IDE automatically compiles code as changes are made.
If no errors are found, TSTool can be run as in the next section.
If errors are found, they need to be addressed by troubleshooting the code (or finishing incomplete edits).

The [Deploying](../deploying/deploying) section discusses how the code is recompiled during build for deployment.
