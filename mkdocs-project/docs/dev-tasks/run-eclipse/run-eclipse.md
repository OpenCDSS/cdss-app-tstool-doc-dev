# TSTool / Development Tasks / Run Eclipse #

Eclipse is run on Windows using the following batch file.
Other similar batch files and scripts can be created as needed to handle variations
in the development environment.
It is generally best to open a command shell and then run the script so that any issues will visible in the open window.

The script ensures that proper environment and Eclipse version is used for the current developer.

```
C:\Users\user\cdss-dev\TSTool\git-repos\cdss-app-tstool-main\build-util\run-eclipse-win64.cmd`
```

See the [run scripts on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenCDSS/cdss-app-tstool-main/tree/master/build-util).
