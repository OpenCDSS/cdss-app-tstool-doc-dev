# TSTool / Initial Project Setup / Eclipse Workspace ##

Eclipse uses a workspace folder to manage the files in a software product.
Although it is possible to use a workspace to work on several products,
it is recommended that TSTool should have its own workspace,
and multiple Eclipse projects will be configured within the workspace,
one for each repository used by TSTool.

The recommended Eclipse workspace folder for different environments is as follows:

*   ![Cygwin icon](../images/cygwin-32.png) Linux:  the workspace folder is `/cygdrive/c/Users/user/cdss-dev/TSTool/eclipse-workspace`
*   ![Linux icon](../images/linux-32.png) Linux:  the workspace folder is `~/cdss-dev/TSTool/eclipse-workspace`
*   ![Windows icon](../images/windows-32.png) Windows: the workspace folder is `C:\Users\user\cdss-dev\TSTool\eclipse-workspace`

The workspace folder is outside of repository files.
