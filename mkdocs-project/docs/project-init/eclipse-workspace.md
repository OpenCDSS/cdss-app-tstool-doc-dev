# TSTool / Initial Project Setup / Eclipse Workspace ##

Eclipse uses a workspace folder to manage the files in a software product.
Although it is possible to use a workspace to work on several products,
it is recommended that TSTool should have its own workspace,
and multiple Eclipse projects will be configured,
one for each repository used by TSTool.

**Need to insert page content similar to StateMod documentation.**
