# TSTool / Development Environment / Machine ##

TSTool software development and testing can be resource-intensive.
It is recommended that a good computer is used in order to minimize issues.

* Windows:  Windows 10 or 7
* Linux:  Confirm that Java 8 is available as a distribution
        + Oracle Java has traditionally be used for development
        + Other Java distributions may be appropriate
* Memory: 8GB minimum, 16GB or 32GB will help improve performance
* Administrator privileges will be required for initial setup and likely will be required
to install and configure additional software later, as well as to test installers
