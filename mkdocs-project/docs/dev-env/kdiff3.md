# TSTool / Development Environment / KDiff3 #

KDiff3 software is highly useful for comparing source files and folders of files.

Install the appropriate version of the software for the operating system from the download page on the following page:

*   [KDiff3 Home](https://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/)

KDiff3 can be used directly or can be configured within `git` to use for the "difftool".

TSTool's `CompareFiles` command also provides an option to use KDiff3 to visually compare files.
