## TSTool Software Overview ##

The TSTool software is a Java application that automates time series processing:

1. Command-based workflow language.
2. General commands including as file manipulation, logic controls such as `For` and `If` commands,
and support for processor properties to allow dynamic scripting.
3. Time series data processing commands for:
	1. Reading time series from files, databases, and web services
	2. Creating time series
	3. Setting time series data
	4. Filling time series data
	5. Manipulating time series data (add, multiply, etc.)
	6. Analyzing time series
	7. Models that use time series (e.g., routing)
	8. Writing time series to files and databases
	9. Checking time series
4. Table processing commands:
	1. Create tables
	2. Read tables
	3. Table/time series transfer
	4. Manipulate tables
	5. Analyze tables
	6. Write tables
5. Other data processing commands:
	1. Datastores (databases)
	2. Ensembles (groups of time series)
	3. Network
	4. Spatial data
	5. Spreadsheet
	6. Template
	7. Visualization
6. General commands
	1. Comments
	2. File handling
	3. Logging
	4. Run control
	5. Testing
7. General commands:
8. Built-in test framework, which is used to run functional tests, suitable for software developers and also
non-programmers who want to validate processing workflows.
9. Multiple run modes including batch, command shell interpreter, user interface, HTTP server.
10. Integration with other tools to leverage the strengths of those tools.

## Development Environment ##

The development environment for contributing to this documentation requires
installation of Python, MkDocs, and Material MkDocs theme.
Python 2 has been used for development.
See the [OWF / Learn MkDocs](http://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/owf-learn-mkdocs/)
documentation for information about installing these tools.

Python 3 with MkDocs and Material theme can also be used,
given that the source documentation files are the same.

## Editing and Viewing Content ##

If the development environment is properly configured, edit and view content as follows:

1. Edit content in the `mkdocs-project/docs` folder and update `mkdocs-project/mkdocs.yml` as appropriate.
2. Run the `build-util/run-mkdocs-serve-8000.sh` script (Cygwin/Linux) or equivalent.
3. View content in a web browser using URL `http://localhost:8000`.

## Style Guide ##

The following are general style guide recommendations for this documentation,
with the goal of keeping formatting simple in favor of focusing on useful content:

* Use the Material MkDocs theme - it looks nice, provides good navigation features, and enables search.
* Follow MkDocs Markdown standards - use extensions beyond basic Markdown when useful.
* Show files and program names as `code (tick-surrounded)` formatting.
* Where a source file can be linked to in GitHub, provide a link so that the most current file can be viewed.
* Use triple-tick formatting for code blocks, with language specifier.
* Use ***bold italics*** when referencing UI components such as menus.
* Use slashes to indicate ***Menu / SubMenu***.
* Images are handled as follows:
	+ Where narrative content pages are sufficiently separated into folders,
	image files exist in those folder with names that match the original TSTool Word documentation.
	This approach has been used for the most part.
	+ If necessary, place images in a folder with the same name as the content file and include
	`-images` at the end of the folder name at the same level (for example `x.md` and `x-images/`)
	or include an `images` folder under the content folder.
	+ When using images in the documents, consider providing a link to look at the full-sized
	image, as follows (normal MkDocs approach does not seem to work?):

```text
The following figure illustrates the ***Mixed Station Analysis*** tool.
<a href="../Menu_Tools_Analysis_MixedStationAnalysis.png">See also the full-size image.</a>

![Menu_Tools_Analysis_MixedStationAnalysis](Menu_Tools_Analysis_MixedStationAnalysis.png)
```
* Minimize the use of inlined HTML elements, but use it where Markdown formatting is limited.
* Although the Material them provides site and page navigation sidebars,
provide in-line table of contents on pages, where appropriate, to facilitate review of page content.
Use a simple list with links to sections on the page.
